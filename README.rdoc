= Ominous

This engine adds warnings to a rails application.

== Installation

Add to your gemfile:

    'gem ominous'  # TODO - gem not created yet

== Migrations

Use this command to copy the ominous migrations over to the parent rails app:

    rake ominous:install:migrations

== Warnings

Warnings are the core model used by Ominous.

    warning = Ominous::Warning.create(:something_happened)

Once a warning has been created, it can triggered with:

    Ominous::Warning.trigger :something_happened

This causes a flag to be set in session, indicating that the associated warning
needs to be displayed.

== Displaying Warnings

To display a warning add this somewhere in the page:

    <%= ominous_warnings %>

This will insert a div of class 'ominous_warnings', containing the warning messages 
(if any have been triggered).

If you wish to use the ominous default styling, add this to your application.scss file:

    *= require ominous/warnings

Alternatively, you can define your own styling.

== Warning text

Warnings contain a title and description. The text used for each needs to be
defined in your locale file. For the something_happened warning used above
the entry needs to look like this:

    en:

      ominous:
        warning:
          something_happened:
            title: Warning
            description: You have triggered a warning.
